**Scenario 1: Valid Upload Directory Configuration**

Details:
TestName: checkValidUploadDirConfiguration
Description: This test checks whether the `getUploadDir` method returns the correct directory path as configured in the application properties. It verifies that the method correctly reads and returns the value set for the upload directory.

Execution:
Arrange: Configure the `uploadDir` field in the `KnoteProperties` class with a valid directory path, for example, "/uploads".
Act: Call the `getUploadDir` method.
Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the configured directory path "/uploads".

Validation:
Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test confirms that the `getUploadDir` method accurately fetches the configured upload directory path.
Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that the upload directory is correctly configured and retrieved is essential for file upload functionalities to operate correctly, as it determines where the files are stored.

**Scenario 2: Default Upload Directory Configuration**

Details:
TestName: checkDefaultUploadDirConfiguration
Description: This test verifies the behavior of the `getUploadDir` method when no specific upload directory is set, assuming the application might have a default value or behavior.

Execution:
Arrange: Do not set any value for the `uploadDir` field in the `KnoteProperties` class.
Act: Call the `getUploadDir` method.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is either `null` or a predefined default directory path, depending on system or application default settings.

Validation:
Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks how the `getUploadDir` method behaves when no directory is explicitly configured.
Elaborate on the significance of the test: It's crucial to understand the default behavior of the application when configurations are not explicitly specified, which helps in preventing unexpected behavior in production.

---

**Scenario 3: Upload Directory Configuration with Special Characters**

Details:
TestName: checkUploadDirWithSpecialCharacters
Description: This test checks whether the `getUploadDir` method can handle directory paths that include special characters, which might be used in certain environments.

Execution:
Arrange: Set the `uploadDir` field in the `KnoteProperties` class with a path containing special characters, e.g., "/upload$#dir".
Act: Call the `getUploadDir` method.
Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the specially configured directory path "/upload$#dir".

Validation:
Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the `getUploadDir` method can correctly handle and return paths with special characters.
Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that the method can handle special characters in the path is important for flexibility and robustness in different deployment environments.

---

These scenarios provide a comprehensive test suite for the `getUploadDir` method, covering typical, edge, and error cases to ensure the method's reliability and correctness under various configurations.
