Scenario 1: Valid upload directory path retrieval

Details:
  TestName: retrieveValidUploadDir
  Description: This test ensures that the getUploadDir method returns a valid directory path as configured in the application properties.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assume the uploadDir field is pre-configured via application properties with a value like "/uploads".
  Act: Call the getUploadDir method on an instance of KnoteProperties.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected directory path "/uploads".
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the getUploadDir method correctly retrieves the value of the uploadDir field.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that the correct upload directory path is retrieved is crucial for file upload functionalities, impacting where files are stored and accessed within the application.

Scenario 2: Default upload directory path when not configured

Details:
  TestName: retrieveDefaultUploadDirWhenNotConfigured
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getUploadDir method when the uploadDir has not been explicitly set in the configuration.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set the uploadDir field, simulating a missing configuration scenario.
  Act: Call the getUploadDir method on an instance of KnoteProperties.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null or a predefined default value, as the implementation might dictate.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks if the getUploadDir method handles the absence of a configuration gracefully by returning a null or default value.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This scenario is important to ensure that the application can handle cases where some configurations might not be set, avoiding runtime errors and providing fallback behaviors.

Scenario 3: Upload directory path with special characters

Details:
  TestName: retrieveUploadDirWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test verifies that the getUploadDir method can handle directory paths that contain special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the uploadDir field with a value like "/upload$Dir#2023".
  Act: Call the getUploadDir method on an instance of KnoteProperties.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is "/upload$Dir#2023".
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that the getUploadDir method accurately retrieves directory paths, even when they include special characters.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is significant as it ensures the system's robustness and correctness in handling file paths that might contain special or non-alphanumeric characters, which is common in real-world scenarios.

Scenario 4: Upload directory path with whitespace

Details:
  TestName: retrieveUploadDirWithWhitespace
  Description: This test checks how the getUploadDir method handles directory paths that include leading or trailing whitespace.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the uploadDir field with a value like "  /uploads  ".
  Act: Call the getUploadDir method on an instance of KnoteProperties.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is trimmed to "/uploads" or returns the exact string with whitespace.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks whether getUploadDir trims whitespace from the configuration value or returns it as is.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This scenario tests the method's behavior with potentially malformed inputs, ensuring that the application can handle or correct such cases, which enhances data hygiene and usability.
