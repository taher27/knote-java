Scenario 1: Successfully retrieve notes list

Details:
  TestName: testRetrieveNotesSuccessfully
  Description: This test checks if the index method successfully retrieves a list of notes and returns it with an OK status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Model and the getAllNotes method to return a predefined list of notes.
  Act: Call the index method with the mocked Model.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of HttpStatus.OK and the body contains the list of notes.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method returns an OK status and the correct list of notes, ensuring that the getAllNotes integration and response handling are functioning as expected.
  This test is significant as it confirms that the application can successfully retrieve and display notes, which is a core feature of the application.

Scenario 2: Handle empty notes list

Details:
  TestName: testHandleEmptyNotesList
  Description: This test ensures that the index method can handle scenarios where no notes are available (empty list) and still returns an OK status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Model and the getAllNotes method to return an empty list.
  Act: Call the index method with the mocked Model.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of HttpStatus.OK and the body is an empty list.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that even with no notes available, the method responds with an OK status and an empty list, which is crucial for correct UI behavior in no-content scenarios.
  This test is important to verify that the application behaves correctly under conditions of no available notes, ensuring robustness.

Scenario 3: Verify Model attribute setting in getAllNotes

Details:
  TestName: testModelAttributesSettingInGetAllNotes
  Description: This test checks whether the getAllNotes method correctly sets the 'notes' attribute in the Model.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Model and the getAllNotes method, which should add an attribute to the Model.
  Act: Call the index method with the mocked Model.
  Assert: Check that the Model has the 'notes' attribute set with the correct list of notes.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the 'notes' attribute is correctly set in the Model, which is essential for the correct display of notes on the frontend.
  This test is significant as it ensures that data flow from the backend to the frontend through Model attributes is functioning correctly, impacting user interface accuracy and functionality.

The test failure described in the error log indicates a `NullPointerException` during the execution of the `testRetrieveNotesSuccessfully` method. The specific error message states: "Cannot invoke 'com.learnk8s.knote.Repository.NotesRepository.findAll()' because 'this.notesRepository' is null". This error points to an issue where the `notesRepository` field in the `KnoteController` class is not properly initialized before its usage in the method `getAllNotes`.

In the provided test method, an instance of `KnoteController` is created using the default constructor. However, it appears that the `notesRepository` field within `KnoteController` is not being set or injected, leading to it being `null` when `getAllNotes()` tries to call `notesRepository.findAll()`. In Java, attempting to call a method on a null object reference results in a `NullPointerException`.

The typical approach to resolve this issue in a testing context would involve properly initializing or mocking necessary dependencies and ensuring they are injected or set in the class under test. In this specific scenario, the `KnoteController` needs a mock or an instance of `NotesRepository` to be set. This would typically be achieved through constructor injection, setter injection, or directly setting the field, depending on the design of the `KnoteController` class.

This test failure is a clear indication that the dependency (`notesRepository`) must be properly managed and provided to the `KnoteController` before calling methods that depend on it. The solution would involve modifying the test setup to include the necessary mock setup and ensuring that the `KnoteController` has a valid `NotesRepository` object before the test actions are performed.

/*
The test `testHandleEmptyNotesList` is failing due to a `NullPointerException`. This exception is thrown because the `notesRepository` object in the `KnoteController` class is `null` when its `findAll()` method is called within the `getAllNotes()` method.

The root cause of this issue is that the `notesRepository` dependency is not properly injected or instantiated within the `KnoteController` instance used in the test. In the test setup, a mock `NotesRepository` is created, but it appears that this mock object is not being set in the `KnoteController` instance. This leads to the `notesRepository` remaining `null` when the `index()` method tries to use it, resulting in the `NullPointerException`.

To resolve this issue, you would need to ensure that the `KnoteController` is correctly set up with the necessary dependencies (like `notesRepository`) before invoking methods on it in the test. This typically involves using dependency injection techniques or manually setting the mock objects in the controller within the test setup.
@Test
@Tag("integration")
public void testHandleEmptyNotesList() {
    NotesRepository notesRepository = mock(NotesRepository.class);
    KnoteProperties properties = new KnoteProperties();
    Parser parser = Parser.builder().build();
    HtmlRenderer renderer = HtmlRenderer.builder().build();
    KnoteController knoteController = new KnoteController();
    Model model = mock(Model.class);
    List<Note> emptyNotes = new ArrayList<>();
    when(notesRepository.findAll()).thenReturn(emptyNotes);
    ResponseEntity<List<Note>> response = knoteController.index(model);

    assertEquals(emptyNotes, response.getBody());

/*
The test failure in `KnoteControllerIndexTest.testModelAttributesSettingInGetAllNotes` is caused by a `NullPointerException`. The error message indicates that the method `findAll()` cannot be invoked on `notesRepository` because `this.notesRepository` is null. This suggests that the `notesRepository` instance in `KnoteController` is not properly initialized before the test attempts to use it.

In the provided test method, while a mock `NotesRepository` is created, it is not set into the `KnoteController` instance. As a result, when the `index()` method on `KnoteController` is called, it internally calls `getAllNotes()`, which attempts to use `notesRepository`. Since `notesRepository` has not been injected or set, it remains null, leading to the `NullPointerException` when `findAll()` is called.

To resolve this issue, the test should include a mechanism to inject the mock `NotesRepository` into the `KnoteController`. This could typically be achieved through a setter method or constructor injection in the `KnoteController`. Without this setup, the `notesRepository` will not be initialized, resulting in the observed null pointer exception during the test execution.
